## Inspiration

As students ourselves, we wanted to find a way to help people who are looking for jobs. While many people upload their resumes and promote themselves online through Handshake, LinkedIn, and etc. It is easy for those links and documents to be lost in the World Wide Web. We thought it would be a great way to carry a physical item to promote your work. We thought carrying resumes was a bit impractical, so the next best thing would be personalized business cards. So we thought of CardFolio! The portfolio in your pocket.

## What it does

CardFolio is a website that allows user's to create their own custom and elegant business cards. User's will register for an account and have to go through our email verification to use the platform. The user will sign in and can now create their own custom business cards in just three easy steps. The first step is picking a template, the user will  have the option among three elegant and beautiful templates. Then the user will input their information, like their name, address, website, and etc. Then the user will be able to view their own custom and beautiful business card to show off to recruiters and hand to clients.

## How we built it

The Front-End of the website was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. The Back-End of the website was built using Flask, Python, Firebase, and Firebase Authentication. We were able to preplan everything using Figma.

## Challenges we ran into

There were many challenges we ran into during our project. Since this hackathon was only 24 hours, working on a team of 2 was very difficult and we both were very stressed and busy building this platform. Another problem was learning how to use Firebase, it was our first time using Firebase. We also had a problem building each business card. Each template was made by us, and since we both did not know much CSS, we had to do a lot of research.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were proud that we built a project that we were really interested in since we believe it will make an impact in the job seeking community. We also challenged ourselves by learning Firebase, it was our first time using it and we are happy that we were able to successfully implement it. We also learned how to use Javascript in web development. In a lot of our old projects we only used HTML and CSS, so it was amazing to learn a new skill. Other than learning new skills we also worked on our CSS skills A LOT.

## What we learned

How to use Firebase, and how to authenticate emails using Firebase. How to use Javascript in a website. A lot of CSS. How Figma can be crucial in a project.

## What's next for CardFolio
As mentioned this was a project that we believe will make an impact, and want to keep working on in the future. So there are a lot things we wanted to add in the future.
1. The ability for the user to save more than 1 business card
2. More templates for the user to choose from
3. A way to share their business card on social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
4. Hosting on AWS
